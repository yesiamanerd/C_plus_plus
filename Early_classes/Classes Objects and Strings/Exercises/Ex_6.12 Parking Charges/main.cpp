// (Parking Charges) 
// A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to 
// park for up to three hours. 
// 
// The garage charges an additional $0.50 per hour for 
// each hour or part thereof in excess of three hours. 
// 
// The maximum charge for any given 24-hour period is $10.00. 
// Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours at a time. 
// 
// Write a program that calculates and prints the parking 
// charges for each of three customers who parked their cars 
// in this garage yesterday. 
// 
// You should enter the hours parked for each customer. 
// Your program should print the results in a neat tabular 
// format and should calculate and print the total of 
// yesterday’s receipts. 
// 
// The program should use the function calculateCharges to
// determine the charge for each customer. 
// 
// Your outputs should appear in the following format:
// Car     Hours       Charge
// 1       1.5         2.00
// 2       4.0         2.50
// 3       24.0        10.00
// TOTAL   29.5        14.50
